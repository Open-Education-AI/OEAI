# Cloud Infrastructure

'Infrastructure as Code' assets will be available here to create the 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP) in all common cloud vendors infrastructure.   These will serve:

* Synapse, Fabric and Databricks in Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform
* AWS

In each, a standard framework approach is adopted using modern data practices, such as the underpinning medallion data architecture.
