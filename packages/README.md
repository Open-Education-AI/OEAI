# Packages

A package is a set of technical assets that work with multiple data sources (exposed as Modules in OEAI) to support an Education Use Case.

Modules and packages have a similar set of technical assets, but modules focus on moving only one data source into a Data Lake, and transforming that data to prepare it for analytics. Packages generally use one or more modules and focus on using those data sources to provide actionable insight or outputs on a specific education challenge or topic
