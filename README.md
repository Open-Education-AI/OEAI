# Welcome to Open Education AI
Open Education AI (OEAI), a not-for-profit social enterprise, has been founded as Centre of Excellence in Data, Analytics and AI for UK Multi Academy Trusts (MATs).  In doing so, it will act as a change agent to help add capacity and capability to the education sector’s use of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve student outcomes and school performance. Our overarching vision is to foster a world where educational equity and improved life chances are a reality for all young people, regardless of background. 

The key drivers behind this collaborative approach for MATs are:
* There is a challenge around capacity and capability for data, analytics and AI human resource in the sector.  
* Very few MATs can afford a full time Infrastructure Architect, Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Data Analyst – four critical roles in a modern data function.
* There are common products used across MATs, and yet individual MATs are forced to reinvent the wheel building data platforms. This is a particularly inefficient use of resources.
* Few single MATs have sufficient data for reliable training of AI for predictive or prescriptive analytics.  All would benefit from shared live benchmarking data, and ethical sharing of insight.
* Data is frequently siloed.  Collective sector action will clarify the importance to EdTech vendors of easy, secure, access to data for the MATs internal business purposes.
* Technology has evolved recently, to make previously very complex tasks achievable with no code/low code, modern data architectures, and AI, and at a cost that is affordable.

## A Minecraft Metaphor - the building blocks of OEAI
OEAI has its roots in [Microsoft's Open Education Analytics](https://openeducationanalytics.org/).  This collaboration of 150+ schooling systems worldwide defined an approach using 'Education Use Cases', 'Modules', 'Packages' and 'Schema', and followed best practices for modern data architectures.  The OEAI framework mirrors this approach but focusses on the UK K12 and School Group (MAT) context to ensure it meets these specific needs and localisation. 

To simplify our approach, we use a Minecraft metaphor for the building blocks:
* __Rock__, or the foundations, represents the Cloud Infrastructure necessary to achieve your educational objectives.  A core OEAI principle is to build assets that can be deployed in any vendors cloud.
* __Grass__ represents a level data playing field.  Layered on the right foundations these 'Modules' extract data from EdTech systems and process it into a standard schema.
* We use __Brick__ 'Packages' to draw together data from Modules and design and create the structures to produce the outcomes.  This might be through data visualisation and reports, machine learning for predictions, or generative AI.
* __Diamond__ is the real value we derive from this actionable insight, and is where the OEAI framework both starts, and ends.  The 'Education Use Case' is an essential part of the process that defines the 'why'.
