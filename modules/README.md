# Modules

Modules are a set of assets for moving a single data source into a data lake, preparing it for exploration, visualisation or advanced analytics and AI.

Modules are the building blocks that create layers of data on the OEAI framework. Modules form the foundation for OEAI packages, which combine multiple data sources for a use case or specific education data scenario. The more modules developed under the OEAI initiative, the more education data sources can easily be ingested into each MATs modern data estate. This will save valuable time and resources for both education systems and analytics partners. OEAI modules eliminate the need for each team to build education data source pipelines ‘from scratch’ and speed up the time to value for analytics investments.
