# The Education Use Case

The purpose of the Education Use Case is to:
* Set out the problem, challenge or opportunity that needs to be addressed, such as digital access and equity, evaluation of interventions or predicting risk. This is the clear identification of the WHY.
* Ensure that it can be delivered successfully through identification of the stakeholders including students and parents if appropriate, and malicious actors.
* Map existing education theory or research to the data. This is important as the data needed to address the challenge may be in different systems, or new data may need to be collected to support the analysis.
* Finally, Responsible AI principles are reviewed and applied to ensure that we have all considered important aspects such as fairness, privacy and accountability.
